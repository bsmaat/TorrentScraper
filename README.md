# TorrentScraper

This is a script I use on my raspberry pi when I want to download something from The Pirate Bay (TPB). My ISP blocks TPB so I have to use a proxy site. At the time of writing, the default proxy site I am using is https://tpb.tw.

The script assumes that deluged is installed on your system.

To run, simply run 

"python pirate.py -s <your search phrase here>"

For more results, type "next", to exit, type "exit". To download, type the ID of the torrent you want (the first column).
